      <ol>
        <li>Smart contract architecture and ABI</li>
        <li>Networks and typical gas costs </li>
        <li>How to create, withdraw from and cancel streams </li>
        <li>
          How to create, withdraw from and cancel {'"'}compounding{'"'} streams
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Codebase</h2>
      <p>
        The Sablier protocol codebase is hosted on <a>GitHub</a> and the source
        code for each contract is verified on Etherscan.
      </p>

      <h2>Minimal Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        We designed the protocol with simplicity in mind: one monolith smart
        contract that adheres to the <a>ERC-1620</a> standard. In our web
        interfaces, we rely on a few other proxies, but we will not cover those
        here.
      </p>

      <h2>Application Binary Interface</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on what web3 library you{"'"}re using, you may need to get
        hold of the Sablier ABI (Application Binary Interface). The ABI acts as
        an interface between two program modules, one of which is the smart
        contract and the other the machine code.
      </p>

      <p>There are two ways to obtain it:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Copy Sablier.json from <a>sablierhq/sablier-abisâ€‹</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Clone <a>sablierhq/sablier</a> and compile the contract yourself
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Networks</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on what Ethereum network you want to use Sablier with, you
        will need a specific contract address.
